# Text-Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling
Language Processing, Text Clustering and Topic Modeling
Project description
Tools: R, H2O, TF-IDF method, K-Means, LDA, PCA, Auto-Encoder
• Clustered unlabeled textual documents into groups based on semantic topics in R.
• Preprocessed text by tokenizing, stemming and stop words removing, and extracted features by term frequency—inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method.
• Trained unsupervised learning models of K-Means Clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Auto-Encoder (Deep Learning)
• Identified semantic topics and keywords of each document for clustering, and calculated document similarity.
• Visualized and Compared model training results by dimensionality reduction utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Auto-Encoder
